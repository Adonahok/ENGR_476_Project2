This code is used to detect a flag of
01111110
then store information from keyboard and display it on screen, until the flag 
01111110
is seen again.

The algorithm used will be to store the last 8 inputs into an array. 
After each time an input is pushed and stored, the temporary array will be 
compared to the flag array 01111110.
If they match, make an boolean flag true and run the code displaying all 
inputs pushed. 
When every input is pushed it is still inputed into the temporary array to see
if it matches the flag array of 01111110.
If matched, it will change the boolean flag to false and run the code as before.
Pushing inputs into a temporary array and waiting until it detects a flag input.
